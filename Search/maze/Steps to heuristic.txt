1. CREATE AN DIMENSIONAL ARRAY WITH THE INITIAL PATH_COST OF 0
2. WE HAVE TO DECLARE A VARIABLE N THAT WILL BE THE NUMBER THAT WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE IN THE STATE(GLOBAL VARIABLE)
3. IN THE ALGORITHM OF ADD CHILD OR CHILDREN WE ARE GONNA INCREASE BY 1 THE PATH_COST IN THE STATE OF THE CHILD
4. THAT VARIABLE N WILL BE CHANGE ON EACH REMOVE CAUSE WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IS THE PATH_COST, BUT IT WILL BE ONLY IF WE HAVE 
   2 OR MORE CHILDREN. BC THERE ARE A POSIBILITY TO CHANGE THE NODES AND OF COURSE THE WAY OF THE SOLUTION.
